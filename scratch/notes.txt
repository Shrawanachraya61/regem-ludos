Goal of the game is to get rid of all your cards.
When it's your turn, you can put a card in the middle (or more than one in certain circumstances)
 - the card you play must be higher than the card in the middle.
 - if you can't play, you must pass
 - you may also pass, even if you can play
If everybody passes, the cards are wiped away, and the last person to play gets to put any card in the middle they want.
 - this person may play doubles (two of the same number) triples (three of the same number) or quadruples (three of the same number)
 - if there are multiple cards in the middle, in order to make a play, a player must also put multiple cards in the middle:
  * if there are two 3's in the middle, the next player may only play two 4's or some number higher than 4.
  * if there are three queens in the middle, the next play may only play three kings or three aces.
The first person to play all their cards is in first place, subsequent players keep playing until one player has cards remaining.
