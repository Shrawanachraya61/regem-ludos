Setting: Arcade building, 10 stories tall.  Each floor has it's own sort of theme or collection, and each contains: a set of arcade games, a ticket store, a food store, .  Every odd-numbered floor except for floor 1 are VR floors.  VR floors are rendered as something like fantasy landscapes: Forest, Mountains, Caves, Volcanos, etc.  Inside these are large areas to explore, similar to an RPG dungeon like pokemon or final fantasy, where Ada and anybody in her party can explore.  Monster encounters are on each of these floors.  These encounters provide drops like tokens and experience, and respawn when Ada leaves the floor.  Each VR floor has a boss that must be defeated to advance further up in the arcade.

Non-VR floors contain arcade games which require tokens to play, but scoring well in them gives tickets that allow Ada to purchase items from ticket shops.  These shops usually sell items that benefit VR space (weapons/armor/potions) but also these stores might sell things that aid in quests, or allow the user to "cheat" in certain games.  These games are not required to win, however, good usage of tokens and tickets will allow Ada a much easier time to traverse the arcade.

An elevator exists which allows a player to access any even numbered floor that they have been to previously.  Ada cannot use this elevator initially due to "plot" reasons.
